# Allocator Baseline Metadata

The source-controlled baseline excerpt and the comparison report are
generated from independent Criterion quick-mode runs, so the same row may
appear with different point estimates in `allocator_baseline_excerpt.csv`
and `allocator_comparison.md`. Treat the baseline as the threshold-gated
reference (regenerated only with `--refresh-baseline`) and the comparison
report as a snapshot of the most recent comparison run.

The baseline below pre-dates the following local-allocator changes. The
current generated comparison files under `target/criterion/` capture the
latest local run; refresh the source-controlled baseline only after an
intentional threshold-policy decision.

- `allocate_large_or_huge` mapping slack reduced from
  `size + alignment + 2 * SEGMENT_SIZE` to
  `size + alignment + SEGMENT_ALIGN + PAGE_SIZE`, saving ~2 MiB − 64 KiB
  per huge allocation.
- `Page` shrunk from 72 bytes (straddling a 64-byte cache line for
  half the array) to 64 bytes (one page per cache line) after removing
  the dead `segment` back-pointer field and `is_empty` helper.
- `MemoryBackend::deallocate` now returns a release-success boolean and
  the wrapper telemetry decrements `current_mapped_bytes` only on
  confirmed release.

The baseline uses Criterion quick mode as a smoke benchmark for local optimization work.
The comparison report records current-to-baseline mean and median ratios for selected Mnemosyne rows.
The summary command does not mutate the source-controlled baseline unless `--refresh-baseline` is provided.
Default summary runs report threshold ratios without failing the command. Threshold enforcement is explicit with `--enforce-thresholds`; the selected gate currently applies per-row thresholds to small/medium/large Mnemosyne cycle latency, small burst retention, small cross-thread handoff, saturated threaded cycles, and segment cache eviction.
The `Threaded saturated small allocation cycles` group replaces the historical threaded row in the source-controlled baseline excerpt. It isolates allocator throughput from bounded-channel worker coordination by increasing per-command allocation work while preserving the same allocator set and worker topology. The current generated quick sample measured Mnemosyne at `217.090 us`, mimalloc at `81.023 us`, and snmalloc at `294.141 us` for 64k four-worker small allocation cycles.
The historical `Threaded small allocation cycles` row remains in the side-by-side report for continuity, but it is not a threshold-gated baseline row because per-sample bounded-channel scheduling variance can dominate allocator changes.
The memory report includes page-refill, recycle, fresh-page, fresh-segment, orphan-adoption, and recycle-sweep counters. After recycle-sweep deferral, the report allocation mix measured `19` page refills and `1` recycle sweep.
